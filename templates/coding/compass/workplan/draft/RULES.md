# Rules: draft/

> Drafts are an idea bank: plan drafts, technical decisions, exploratory notes.

## What goes here

- Early-stage ideas that are not yet ready for backlog
- Technical decision records
- Exploratory notes and research

## Naming

```
DRAFT-YYYY-MM-DD-description.md
```

Drafts **never** carry an issue identifier, regardless of tracker configuration.

## Key rules

- Drafts do **not** follow the BACKLOG → CODING → DONE workflow
- When a draft matures, promote it to `backlog/` as a formal plan
- See `workplan/README.md` for full reference
