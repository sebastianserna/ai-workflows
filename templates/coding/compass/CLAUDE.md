# CLAUDE.md

**Claude Code configuration for this project.**

## Main instructions

All conventions, rules, project structure, and style guides are defined in:

@AGENTS.md

Read that file before performing any task.

## Key structure

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `workplans/` | Work plan management (`(draft/) -> backlog/ -> coding/ -> done/`) and knowledge base (`knowledge/`) |

## Plans and decisions

Before proposing improvements, check `workplans/` for existing plans to avoid duplicates.
